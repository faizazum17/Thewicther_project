                <h3>Triss Merigold</h3>
                <p>Triss Merigold of Maribor was a legendary Temerian sorceress of the 13th century. 
    Called Fourteenth of the Hill by her contemporaries because she was erroneously thought to have been 
    killed during the Battle of Sodden Hill, she passed into history as Merigold the Fearless. A member 
    of King Foltest's royal council along with Fercart and Keira Metz, as well as a founding member of 
    the Lodge of Sorceresses, she was involved in politics for most of her life.</p>

                <h3>Yenefer of Vengerberg</h3>
                <p>Yennefer of Vengerberg, born on Belleteyn in 1173, was a sorceress who lived in Vengerberg, 
    the capital city of Aedirn. She was Geralt of Rivia's true love and a mother figure to Ciri, 
    whom she viewed like a daughter to the point that she did everything she could to rescue the 
    girl and keep her from harm.</p>

                <h3>Geralt of Rivia</h3>
                <p>Geralt of Rivia was a legendary witcher of the School of the Wolf active throughout the 13th 
    century. He loved the sorceress Yennefer, considered the love of his life despite their tumultuous relationship, 
    and became Ciri's adoptive father. During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities. 
    Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers.</p>

                <h3>Ciri</h3>
                <p>Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (better known as Ciri), was born in 1252 or 1253,[4] and most likely 
    during the Belleteyn holiday.[5] She was the sole princess of Cintra, the daughter of Pavetta and Emhyr var 
    Emreis (who was using the alias "Duny" at the time) as well as Queen Calanthe's granddaughter.</p>

                <h3>Eredin</h3>
                <p>Eredin is the fourth and final member of the Wild Hunt crew. This boss battle is long and 
    taxing, but is more than doable. The key to the entire fight is being patient and not becoming greedy with your 
    strikes. When you try to wail on Eredin, he will hit backâ€”hard and fast. Quen is your best friend during this 
    fight. Make sure to use it often.</p>
