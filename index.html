				<h3>Triss Merigold</h3>
				<p>Triss Merigold of Maribor was a legendary Temerian sorceress of the 13th century. 
Called Fourteenth of the Hill by her contemporaries because she was erroneously thought to have been 
killed during the Battle of Sodden Hill, she passed into history as Merigold the Fearless. A member 
of King Foltest's royal council along with Fercart and Keira Metz, as well as a founding member of 
the Lodge of Sorceresses, she was involved in politics for most of her life.</p>

				<h3>Yenefer of Vengerberg</h3>
				<p>Yennefer of Vengerberg, born on Belleteyn in 1173, was a sorceress who lived in Vengerberg, 
the capital city of Aedirn. She was Geralt of Rivia's true love and a mother figure to Ciri, 
whom she viewed like a daughter to the point that she did everything she could to rescue the 
girl and keep her from harm.</p>

				<h3>Eredin</h3>
				<p>Eredin is the fourth and final member of the Wild Hunt crew. This boss battle is long and 
taxing, but is more than doable. The key to the entire fight is being patient and not becoming greedy with your 
strikes. When you try to wail on Eredin, he will hit backâ€”hard and fast. Quen is your best friend during this 
fight. Make sure to use it often.</p>
